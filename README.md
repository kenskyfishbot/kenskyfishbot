# kaholo-plugin-git
Git plugin for Kaholo. 

This plugin is a wrapper for the git cli. Therefore git cli must be installed on the agent. 
Git version must be equal or higher than 2.10.0, due to the usage of the `core.sshCommand` used.

## Method: Clone
Clone the specified git repository. Can clone using either SSH key or username and password.
You can use this method like "git pull" in case you already cloned the repo, if specifying overwrite=true.
